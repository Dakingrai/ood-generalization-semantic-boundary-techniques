# Contributing to reactivesocket-cpp

We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible.

## Our Development Process

The Github project is the source of truth. All development is done via branches that are merged in via Pull Requests. 

## Pull Requests
We actively welcome your pull requests.

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Make sure your code is properly formatted by running `devtools/format_all.sh`.

## Issues
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Please ensure your description is
clear and has sufficient instructions to be able to reproduce the issue.

Facebook has a [bounty program](https://www.facebook.com/whitehat/) for the safe
disclosure of security bugs. In those cases, please go through the process
outlined on that page and do not file a public issue.

## Coding Style
Most of the code formatting will be handled for you by marvellous `clang-format`, which, at least on OSX, you can obtain from Homebrew via `brew install clang-format`. To ensure proper formatting, simply run `devtools/format_all.sh` before submitting a patch.

As far as naming conventions are concerned, please try matching existing code as much as possible.
